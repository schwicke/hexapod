## 3d-printed parts
OpenScad has been used to design the 3d printed parts for this robot. Source files are in the scad folder. These may change at any time and might not work as expected.

The stl folder contains the latest released versions of the plastic parts in STL format, which can be used with your favorite slicer. The intention is to keep them more stable than the source OpenScad files above.
