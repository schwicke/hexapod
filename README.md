# A hexapod robot
The aim of this little project is the creation of a fully self-designed and 3d printed hexapod robot. Basic features:

* 6 legs with 3 Dynamixel motors each
* Controls and feedback through RaspberryPi
* Plastic parts self-designed and 3d printed.

The longer term goal is to equip this robot with various additional sensors, giving feedback about the environment and orientation of the robot.
