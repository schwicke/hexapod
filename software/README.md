# Software
The software found in this repository is very rudimentary and at a PoC level. No installation is needed.
## scan.py
This tool simply scans the bus and returns the ids of the motors it found. There should be 3x6 so 18 of them.
## zero_position.py
This tool simply sets all motors to their zero position. In effect, the robot will stand up.
## walk.py
The walk.py script is a bit more complex. It implements some logic which allows the robot to move a few steps forward and backward.
